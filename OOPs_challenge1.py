# Challenge 1: Square Numbers and Return Their Sum
# ðŸ”´ In this challenge, implement a method that squares passing variables and returns their sum.

# Problem statement: Implement a class Point that has three properties and a method. All these attributes (properties and methods) should be public. This problem can be broken down into two tasks:

# Task 1: ðŸ‘‰ Implement a constructor to initialize the values of three properties: x, y, and z.

# Task 2: ðŸ‘‰ Implement a method, sqSum(), in the Point class which squares x, y, and z and returns their sum.

# Sample properties 1, 3, 5

# Sample method output 35


class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y, z):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.z = z

    def sqSum(self):
        return self.x**2 + self.y**2 + self.z**2


#creating 'point' object and computing the square sum
point = Point(1, 3, 5)
result = point.sqSum()
print(result)

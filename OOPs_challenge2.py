# Challenge 2: Implement a Calculator Class

# ðŸ”´ In this challenge, implement a calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Problem statement Write a Python class called Calculator by completing the tasks below:

# Task 1

# ðŸ‘‰ Initializer

# Implement an initializer to initialize the values of num1 and num2. Properties

# â€¢ num1
# â€¢ num2
# Task 2

# ðŸ‘‰ Methods

# â€¢ add() is a method that returns the sum of num1 and num2.
# â€¢ subtract() is a method that returns the subtraction of num1 from num2.
# â€¢ multiply() is a method that returns the product of num1 and num2.
# â€¢ divide() is a method that returns the division of num2 by num1.
# Input - Pass numbers (integers or floats) in the initializer.

# Output - addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication

# Sample input

# obj = Calculator(10, 94)
# obj.add()
# obj.subtract()
# obj.multiply()
# obj.divide()
# Sample output

# 104
# 84
# 940
# 9.4





class Calculator:
    def __init__(self, num1, num2):
        self.num1 = num1
        self.num2 = num2

#creating def() function with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
# The add, subtract, multiply, and division
#  methods perform the respective arithmetic operations on num1 and num2 and return the results.
  
    def add(self):
        return self.num1 + self.num2

    def subtract(self):
        return self.num2 - self.num1

    def multiply(self):
        return self.num1 * self.num2

    def divide(self):
        return self.num2 / self.num1


#creating calculator object with num1 as 10 and num2 as 94

obj = Calculator(10, 94)
addition = obj.add()
subtraction = obj.subtract()
multiplication = obj.multiply()
division = obj.divide()

print(addition)     
print(subtraction)   
print(multiplication) 
print(division)
